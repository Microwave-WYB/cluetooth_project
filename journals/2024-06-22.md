To celebrate my birthday I've decided to remove all data sources from the server package. We should use the API as a single protocol to insert data into the database. This enhances loose coupling between the server's main functionality and data sources. For example, anyone can write a data source insertion adapter without understanding of the database structure. They simply call the API.

I've also subscribed this repo in our Slack channel so we can receive notifications on commits!
## Tasks
- [x] Implement creation API for `BLEDevice` with support of adding raw records and UUIDs.
- [x] Implement creation API for `AndriodApp` with support of adding UUIDs.
- [x] Implement test cases for the new API endpoints
- [ ] Remove the current `/sync_gcs` endpoint, and create a python script that downloads data from Google Cloud Storage, decrypt, and  upload to the server via the API.
